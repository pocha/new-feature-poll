Poll app for website owners
===========================

Slick rails app which lets website owners collect feedback on a newly deployed feature from their user. Simply deploy the app on the server, add a poll (check test file inside spec to know how), embed the poll below the feature (you will get a url like http://yourdomain/polls/1) & you are good to go.
